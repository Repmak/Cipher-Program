# CipherProgram
College project coded from 11-22 to 12-22.

The assignment requirements are as follows:
  - Tkinter must be used for the UI.
  - The user must be given the option to encrypt and decrypt strings using various encryption methods.
  - Character frequency must be displayed using a graph.

Ensure tkinter and matplotlib are installed. Run Cipher_Program.py to run the program.

Note: Images are used instead of text boxes due to font restrictions on college computers.
