# CipherProgram
College project coded from 11-22 to 12-22.

The assignment requirements are as follows:
  - Tkinter must be used for the UI.
  - The user must be given the option to encrypt and decrypt strings using various encryption methods.

Ensure tkinter and matplotlib are installed. Run Cipher_Program.py.

Note: Images are used to bypass restrictions on college computers (due to being unable to install fonts). Text boxes would be used if I had coded the program on my personal PC.
